# 4.2 Evaluation of Usability Features

Features from the [design frame](../design-and-development/systems-diagram.md)

## Effective

| Feature No. | Description                                                  | Success/Fail |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------ |
| 1           | Create a clear goal to reach to determine the end of a level | Success      |

### Feature 1

There is a clear goal to reach to determine the end of a level: a question is displayed and you need to hit the correct answer. In my [survey](../testing/3.2-usability-testing.md), 7/8 respondents said that everything in the game is obvious, and 7/8 respondents said that the game is easy to learn. This implies that the goal of my game is clear.

## Efficient

| Feature No. | Description                                                                                      | Success/Fail |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------ |
| 2           | Create a menu system that is quick and easy to navigate through                                  | Success      |
| 3           | Create a controls system that isn't too complicated but allows the player to do multiple actions | Success      |

### Feature 2

The menu system uses keys on a keyboard as inputs, and there are easy instructions to follow.

Everyone agrees that the menus are simple to understand, so I can say with certainty that I have succeeded with this criterion.

### Feature 3

To increase engagement with the game, my game's control system should be easy to use, but have multiple actions. As mentioned previously, you can use either WASD or the arrow keys to control the player, and you can move sideways and jump. The system is not too complicated: 7/8 respondents of the survey said that the controls were easy to use.

## Engaging

| Feature No. | Description                                        | Success/Fail |
| ----------- | -------------------------------------------------- | ------------ |
| 4           | Create a series of levels to work through          | Success      |
| 5           | Incorporate a style of game art the suits the game | Fail         |

### Feature 4

My game uses random generation of the platforms and questions/answers to generate a series of levels. It is random every time a level is loaded, therefore there are thousands of different possible levels. As such, the game is not quite as repetitive.

### Feature 5

I have not managed to incorporate a style of game art that suits the game - as I have concentrated on the game's gameplay, the graphics are still quite rudimentary. If I had time to iron out any faults with the gameplay, and if there was time left over, I would make the game look nicer with a suitable style of game art.

## Error Tolerant

| Feature No. | Description                                                        | Success/Fail |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------ |
| 6           | The game doesn't crash                                             | Success      |
| 7           | The game does not contain any bugs that damage the user experience | Fail         |

### Feature 6

The game must not crash for the game to be usable. No-one in the survey reported crashing, and I have not had the game crash on me in my playtesting. The game not crashing can be resolved with error code that deals with errors and exceptions correctly.

### Feature 7

The game should not contain bugs that damage the user's experience, as they will make the game more annoying and unfun to play. Unfortunately, there are still occasionally impossible levels in my game. Also, enemies can spawn too close to the player, not giving them enough chance to react.

## Easy To Learn

| Feature No. | Description                                                            | Success/Fail |
| ----------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------ |
| 8           | Create a list of controls for the game                                 | Success      |
| 9           | Create an in-level guide that helps players learn how to play the game | Fail         |

### Feature 8

There should be a list of controls for the game, as players should be able to know how to play and what exactly to do, especially in a game like mine that is targeted at all ages.

This screen shows the controls for my game, so there is a list of controls and this criterion is fulfilled.

### Feature 9

A guide in the game that guides players on what to do is useful for accessibility and general enjoyment of the game. However, I have not implemented this in my game. I feel that the instructions screen shown above is good enough for telling people what they need to do.
