### Criterion 1

This criteria is for adding randomly generated platforms to each level screen. I have achieved this success criterion by adding code to randomly generate three platforms on a certain level (y-position), with there being three different levels for a total of nine platforms. This adds a random aspect to the game, making sure that no level is the same, increasing replayability value.

### Criterion 2

This criteria states that everything must be obvious to the player. Here is an example of a level screen:

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

There are platforms to jump on, spikes and an enemy to avoid, answers to hit, and a score counter. This is all that there needs to be on the level screen. Likewise, as seen previously, the other screens are just text. Therefore, I would say that everything is obvious to the player.

### Criterion 3

The player must not immediately die when a level is started. In recent playtesting I have not had any instant deaths, but sometimes there has been very little time to react before dying because an enemy is instantly coming towards you. Therefore I would say this criterion is partially met.

### Criterion 4

This criterion states that there must be blocks and spikes on the level, and that spikes must kill the player when touched. I did not add blocks, but I have added spikes on each side of the floor, and as they are marked with "danger", they will kill the player when touched. They are generated onto the level each time one is loaded.

### Criterion 5

This criterion is for generating enemies onto the level that kill the player when touched. When 1, 2 or 3 is selected on the difficulty screen, respectively 1, 2 and 3 enemies are generated. They are marked with "danger" therefore they kill the player when touched. They move left and right across the level too.

### Criterion 6

Questions must be generated onto every level. This is the case, and there are addition, subtraction and multiplication questions for variation. Answers must also be generated onto the level. This is also the case, and their positions are randomly generated. The three incorrect answers are random too, adding to the replayability value, crucial for games like mine.

### Criterion 7

To avoid unfair deaths, enemies must be generated away from the player. This ties in with [criterion 3](1.5-success-criteria.md#criterion-3), so it is partially met. Enemies are generated away form the player somewhat, but they can immediately come towards the player, so there can be very little time to react properly before being hit and dying. Obstacles (i.e. spikes) are always generated away from the player.

### Non-functional

These are features which are not descriptions of functionality. They are more like suitability, such as age rating appropriateness, or performance of algorithms/response times for UI etc.
