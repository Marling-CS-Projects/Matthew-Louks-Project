# 4.3 Maintenance and Future Development

## Current Limitations of Project

* Graphics: The game is rudimentary graphically and the looks should be improved if I want to make the game more appealing for potential players.
* Impossible levels: The game still has impossible level screens in it. I would need to get rid of these for my game to be truly complete, and to make the game more appealing and more fun.
