# 4.3 Maintenance and Future Development

## Current Limitations of Project

* Graphics: The game is rudimentary graphically and the looks should be improved if I want to make the game more appealing for potential players.
* Impossible levels: The game still has impossible level screens in it. I would need to get rid of these for my game to be truly complete, and to make the game more appealing and more fun.
* Complexity: Currently, the questions consist of a number, an operation and another number. I would like to make more complex questions for my game, perhaps divison questions and questions with more than two numbers and one operation.

## Future Development

### Short Term Bug Fixes

I would not say that there are any bugs in my game that can be fixed short-term. Short-term bug fixing would be better for getting rid of things like game crashing and unresponsiveness; I have neither of these problems in my project.

### Long Term Addressing Limitations

* Graphics: Improve the graphics, maybe by adding new and different backgrounds and better-quality sprites.
* Impossible levels: Continue to try and get rid of these, with new coding.
* Complexity: Make it so that more numbers and operations are spawned on the level screen, and that the resulting answer is calculated in the right order (maybe using order of operations).
