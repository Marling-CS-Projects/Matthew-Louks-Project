## Thinking Abstractly and Visualisation

Abstraction is the process of removing unnecessary detail from something to focus on the core details. This can be used in problem-solving, where you remove anything that is not necessary, leaving you with the core details to concentrate on, allowing you to solve the problem more easily. Here are some abstracted key features of my game.

* The designs will be basic. I will make the design look nice, but not complicated as to keep the game simple. There will be a range of colours as to keep the game varied. Likewise, the graphics will be basic.
* The level will be basic enough too. It will have a basic layout which is easy to understand, but there can be some randomness to the layout for variation.
* The user interface will tell the player everything they need to know and no more. There will be text for the score, and for the question and answers. Outside of the gameplay, there just needs to be buttons with text and nothing else.
* The enemies will kill the player if they touch one of them, and they will move around on the platforms. Any enemies and other obstacles will spawn randomly, but not within a certain distance of the player's starting position.

This is abstract information - the parts of the game have been broken down into small chunks as to help me solve the problem of how to make the game more easily.
