# 1.4a Features of Proposed Solution

## Game Mechanics

### Movement

The movement mechanics in the mathematical platformer will be simple. I will use a 'linear acceleration' system for the character, where it accelerates at a linear pace to a set top speed. For deceleration, it will decelerate at a linear pace until stopping. The character will not be allowed to go through walls, so hitting a wall will stop the character from proceeding in the direction of the wall. A linear acceleration system is more realistic as no-one instantly stops in real life and might be more fun to use than a single-speed system as it adds a bit more of a challenge to the platforming aspect of this game.

### Controls

The controls will be very simple for this game. The only controls necessary are the arrow keys and/or WASD to move the character. The up arrow and/or W would make the character jump, the left arrow and/or A would accelerate the character in the left-hand direction, and the right arrow and/or D would accelerate the character in the right-hand direction. I cannot think of a use for the down arrow and/or S.

## Limitations

### Limitation 1

Description of a limitation, due to scope/time constraints or difficulty of implementation.
