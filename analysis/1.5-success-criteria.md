| 1        | The level should be composed of platforms that are generated randomly                                        | The level needs to have a layout that is not the same and repetitive            | <ul><li><a href="1.4a-features-of-the-proposed-solution.md#level-design">Level design</a></li></ul>                                                                                                                                  |
| 2        | Everything on the level screen needs to be obvious to the player                                             | This game is supposed to be accessible for everyone                             | <ul><li><a href="1.2-stakeholders.md">Stakeholders</a></li></ul>                                                                                                                                                                     |

| 4        | Obstacles (blocks and spikes) must be generated onto the level, and spikes must kill the player when touched | Obstacles create an extra challenge for the player, which makes a game more fun | <ul><li><a href="1.4a-features-of-the-proposed-solution.md#obstacles">Obstacles</a></li></ul>                                                                                                                                        |
| 5        | Enemies must be generated onto the level, and they must kill the player when touched                         | Enemies also add a challenge for the player                                     | <ul><li><a href="1.4a-features-of-the-proposed-solution.md#enemies">Enemies</a></li></ul>                                                                                                                                            |
| 6        | Questions and answers must be generated onto the level, and one answer must be correct                       | This is a core part of the game, as there is an educational side to it too      | <ul><li><a href="1.4a-features-of-the-proposed-solution.md#answers">Answers</a></li></ul>                                                                                                                                            |

### Non-functional

These are features which are not descriptions of functionality. They are more like suitability, such as age rating appropriateness, or performance of algorithms/response times for UI etc.
