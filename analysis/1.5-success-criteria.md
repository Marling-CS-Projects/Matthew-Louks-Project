### Mechanics

<table><thead><tr><th width="103">Ref No.</th><th width="196">Criterion</th><th width="235">Justification</th><th>Reference</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>13</td><td>The character must be able to move left and right</td><td>If you cannot move a character properly, there is not much of a game to play</td><td><ul><li><a href="1.4a-features-of-the-proposed-solution.md#movement">Movement</a></li></ul></td></tr><tr><td>14</td><td>The character must be able to jump</td><td>Jumping is vital for getting to the correct answer, and for the platformer aspect of this game in general</td><td><ul><li><a href="1.4a-features-of-the-proposed-solution.md#movement">Movement</a></li></ul></td></tr><tr><td>15</td><td>The movement should use 'linear acceleration'</td><td>This gives the game more realistic physics, making the game more fun and more challenging</td><td><ul><li><a href="1.4a-features-of-the-proposed-solution.md#movement">Movement</a></li></ul></td></tr><tr><td>16</td><td>The controls should be either the arrow keys and/or WASD</td><td>These are common ways to control a character on a computer game, and since many people have used these keys to control a character before, it maximises accessibility</td><td><ul><li><a href="1.4a-features-of-the-proposed-solution.md#controls">Controls</a></li></ul></td></tr><tr><td>17</td><td>Enemies should respond to physics in the same way as the player</td><td>This adds some realism to the game, and physics that are as realistic as possible are more fun to use</td><td><ul><li><a href="1.4a-features-of-the-proposed-solution.md#enemies">Enemies</a></li></ul></td></tr><tr><td>18</td><td>The player and any enemies must not clip through platforms and obstacles</td><td>Clipping through solid objects is a common error that must not be overseen</td><td><ul><li><a href="1.4a-features-of-the-proposed-solution.md#movement">Movement</a></li></ul></td></tr></tbody></table>

### Non-functional

These are features which are not descriptions of functionality. They are more like suitability, such as age rating appropriateness, or performance of algorithms/response times for UI etc.
