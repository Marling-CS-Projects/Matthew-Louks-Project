| -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 1        | The level should be composed of platforms that are generated randomly                                        | The level needs to have a layout that is not the same and repetitive                 | <ul><li><a href="1.4a-features-of-the-proposed-solution.md#level-design">Level design</a></li></ul>                                                                                                                                  |
| 2        | Everything on the level screen needs to be obvious to the player                                             | This game is supposed to be accessible for everyone, so they need to know what to do | <ul><li><a href="1.2-stakeholders.md">Stakeholders</a></li></ul>                                                                                                                                                                     |
| 3        | The player should not immediately die upon starting a level                                                  | The game must also be fair. An unfair game is not accessible                         | <ul><li><a href="1.2-stakeholders.md">Stakeholders</a></li><li><a href="1.4a-features-of-the-proposed-solution.md#enemies">Enemies</a></li><li><a href="1.4a-features-of-the-proposed-solution.md#obstacles">Obstacles</a></li></ul> |
| 4        | Obstacles (blocks and spikes) must be generated onto the level, and spikes must kill the player when touched | Obstacles create an extra challenge for the player, which makes a game more fun      | <ul><li><a href="1.4a-features-of-the-proposed-solution.md#obstacles">Obstacles</a></li></ul>                                                                                                                                        |
| 5        | Enemies must be generated onto the level, and they must kill the player when touched                         | Enemies also add a challenge for the player                                          | <ul><li><a href="1.4a-features-of-the-proposed-solution.md#enemies">Enemies</a></li></ul>                                                                                                                                            |
| 6        | Questions and answers must be generated onto the level, and one answer must be correct                       | This is a core part of the game, as there is an educational side to it too           | <ul><li><a href="1.4a-features-of-the-proposed-solution.md#answers">Answers</a></li></ul>                                                                                                                                            |
| 7        | Enemies and obstacles must be generated at a distance away from the player                                   | This ties in with point 3: it is unfair for the player to die upon starting a level  | <ul><li><a href="1.2-stakeholders.md">Stakeholders</a></li><li><a href="1.4a-features-of-the-proposed-solution.md#enemies">Enemies</a></li><li><a href="1.4a-features-of-the-proposed-solution.md#obstacles">Obstacles</a></li></ul> |

### User Interface

| ------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 8       | The game should have a simple-to-understand menu                                    | It should be obvious how to access the game, and it should look good, as for a good first impression | <ul><li><a href="1.4a-features-of-the-proposed-solution.md#user-interface">User Interface</a></li></ul> |
| 9       | The game should have a difficulty screen                                            | To make the game more fun for everyone, there should be options to make the game easier or harder    | <ul><li><a href="1.4a-features-of-the-proposed-solution.md#user-interface">User Interface</a></li></ul> |
| 10      | The game should have a score function                                               | It is useful for the player to know how many questions they have got right                           | <ul><li><a href="1.4a-features-of-the-proposed-solution.md#user-interface">User Interface</a></li></ul> |
| 11      | The game should have a pause function                                               | This is useful for accessibility, as it means players can come back to a level after a short while   | <ul><li><a href="1.4a-features-of-the-proposed-solution.md#user-interface">User Interface</a></li></ul> |
| 12      | At the end of a game, there should be options to try again or to return to the menu | This is also good for accessibility, and it makes the game feel more complete                        | <ul><li><a href="1.4a-features-of-the-proposed-solution.md#user-interface">User Interface</a></li></ul> |

### Mechanics

| Ref No. | Criterion                                                                | Justification                                                                                                                                                         | Reference                                                                                   |
| ------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 13      | The character must be able to move left and right                        | If you cannot move a character properly, there is not much of a game to play                                                                                          | <ul><li><a href="1.4a-features-of-the-proposed-solution.md#movement">Movement</a></li></ul> |
| 14      | The character must be able to jump                                       | Jumping is vital for getting to the correct answer, and for the platformer aspect of this game in general                                                             | <ul><li><a href="1.4a-features-of-the-proposed-solution.md#movement">Movement</a></li></ul> |
| 15      | The movement should use 'linear acceleration'                            | This gives the game more realistic physics, making the game more fun and more challenging                                                                             | <ul><li><a href="1.4a-features-of-the-proposed-solution.md#movement">Movement</a></li></ul> |
| 16      | The controls should be either the arrow keys or WASD                     | These are common ways to control a character on a computer game, and since many people have used these keys to control a character before, it maximises accessibility | <ul><li><a href="1.4a-features-of-the-proposed-solution.md#controls">Controls</a></li></ul> |
| 17      | Enemies should respond to physics in the same way as the player          | This adds some realism to the game, and physics that are as realistic as possible are more fun to use                                                                 | <ul><li><a href="1.4a-features-of-the-proposed-solution.md#enemies">Enemies</a></li></ul>   |
| 18      | The player and any enemies must not clip through platforms and obstacles | Clipping through solid objects is a common error that must not be overseen                                                                                            | <ul><li><a href="1.4a-features-of-the-proposed-solution.md#movement">Movement</a></li></ul> |

### Non-functional

These are features which are not descriptions of functionality. They are more like suitability, such as age rating appropriateness, or performance of algorithms/response times for UI etc.

| -------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 19       | The game must follow the requirements of PEGI 3                             | This is the lowest PEGI rating, and my game should be suitable for everyone                                             | <ul><li><a href="1.2-stakeholders.md#demographics">Demographics</a></li></ul>               |
| 20       | The game should not crash                                                   | Game crashing is frustrating for players, and most well-polished games do not crash when running normally               | <ul><li><a href="1.1-problem-identification.md">Problem Identification</a></li></ul>        |
| 21       | The game should run smoothly                                                | Games that are choppy are not fun to play. Ideally my game would run at at least 30 frames per second, preferably more. | <ul><li><a href="1.1-problem-identification.md">Problem Identification</a></li></ul>        |
| 22       | The game should be responsive to user input                                 | Games which do not respond are also not fun to play                                                                     | <ul><li><a href="1.1-problem-identification.md">Problem Identification</a></li></ul>        |
| 23       | There should be colours that distinguish platforms, obstacles, enemies etc. | This aids accessibility and general enjoyment of the game, as it makes understanding it easier                          | <ul><li><a href="1.4a-features-of-the-proposed-solution.md#graphics">Graphics</a></li></ul> |
