### Overview

Celeste is a 2D platformer games released in 2018 by Extremely OK Games. In this game, a young woman called Madeline has to climb up Celeste Mountain whilst facing obstacles from both the mountain and herself (_Celeste Wiki, n.d._).

### Controls

With this game you can do many different moves, something that is not needed for my game. However there are some basic controls, such as those for moving and jumping, respectively moving the left stick, and the A or Y buttons (_Neoseeker, n.d._). Those controls are for a console controller - my game is for computers and would just use the arrow keys for moving and jumping. The controls are described as 'simple to learn and hard to master' (_Celeste Wiki, n.d._).

### Platforming

The platforming element is a strong element of Celeste. The levels are described as 'challenging' (_Celeste Wiki, n.d._). The above picture shows a certain part of a level. You can see that there is a jump that looks very challenging. Some of the platforming in this game would require certain moves, something which the mathematical platformer would not need, and the difficulty of the platforming would depend on the difficulty selected.
