### Overview

Celeste is a 2D platformer games released in 2018 by Extremely OK Games. In this game, a young woman called Madeline has to climb up Celeste Mountain whilst facing obstacles from both the mountain and herself (_Celeste Wiki, n.d._).

### Controls

With this game you can do many different moves, something that is not needed for my game. However there are some basic controls, such as those for moving and jumping, respectively moving the left stick, and the A or Y buttons (_Neoseeker, n.d._). Those controls are for a console controller - my game is for computers and would just use the arrow keys for moving and jumping. The controls are described as 'simple to learn and hard to master' (_Celeste Wiki, n.d._). The 'hard to master' aspect of this means the game will most likely not be suitable for younger players (it is rated PEGI 7) (_videostandards.org.uk, n.d._).

### Platforming

The platforming element is a strong element of Celeste. The levels are described as 'challenging' (_Celeste Wiki, n.d._). The above picture shows a certain part of a level. You can see that there is a jump that looks very challenging. Some of the platforming in this game would require certain moves, something which the mathematical platformer would not need, and the difficulty of the platforming would depend on the difficulty selected.

| Feature                   | Justification                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

| The more 'basic' controls | if the game has basic controls it will be easier for people to understand and to play. This is useful for a wide range of audiences. I will most likely just use arrows and/or WASD for this.                    |
| Colours (to an extent)    | Celeste's levels have a wide range of colours, and games are more interesting if they are colourful. Although my game's colours will be nowhere near as complex as Celeste's, I hope to add some form of colour. |
| Platforming               | I want to try and keep some of the platforming aspect of this game. I could add things such as wall climbing to my game to add a bit more variation without making it too complex for my demographic.            |

| Feature          | Justification                                                                                                                                   |

| Storyline        | this would probably not be necessary for a mathematical platformer, as the game is intended to be educational too.                              |
| Different worlds | again, I don't think this would be necessary. Although having different worlds makes the game more interesting, it adds unnecessary complexity. |
| Objects          | Celeste has many different objects that the player can use. This would be too complex for the mathematical platformer.                          |
