# 1.1 Problem Identification

Video games have had a long history. One of the first video games was the 1958 game 'Tennis for Two', which used an analogue computer and an oscilloscope. Throughout the years there have been many popular games, such as Pacman, Mario and The Sims (_The Ultimate Resource for Video Game Design, 2019_). All of this has lead to the entire video games industry, accounting for $9.5 billion in sales for 2006 and 2007 in the USA alone (_Brookhaven National Library, 2008_). This growth has continued into the Covid-19 pandemic, as there was a 39% increase in time spent gaming during the pandemic, and the video game market in the USA is worth $97.67 billion (_Clement, 2021_). E-sports were used by many as a way to stay entertained, and 70% of E-sports fans (and 52% of non-E-sports fans) said companies should acknowledge Covid-19 when communicating to customers (_Nielsen, n.d._). In 2020, action, sports and adventure games were ranked as the most popular video game types (_Straits Research, n.d._). 91% of teachers in the UK and US who turned to gaming to help engage students in virtual lessons claim it's helped (_Skwarczek, n.d._). There is much evidence that the video games industry is booming, and graphs such as the one below show this in figures.

To make a good game that would keep people entertained, it would need to be interactive (_Pluralsight, 2014_). Otherwise, it would hardly even be a game. Also, the controls need to be good. Difficulty is good too, but difficulty must be fair for a game to be good - as in, losing should not be the player's fault (_De, 2021_). Therefore, bugs must be ironed out.

Platformer games have helped to bring in some of the most iconic names in gaming, and they remain ever popular (_Brooks, 2021_). The Super Mario platformer series has earned almost $16 billion (_Hallman, 2020_), showing that there is or has been a large want for at least some forms of platformer over the past few decades. The Super Mario series has largely simple controls, namely arrow controls to move, and other buttons for other certain features on some of the games. The mathematical platformer will just have arrow controls to keep simplicity.
