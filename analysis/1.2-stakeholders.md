# 1.2 Stakeholders

## Customer Role

The role a customer plays here is large. A customer of a game has wants and needs in relation to said game (_Business LibreTexts, 2019_). It is the game maker's job to fulfill these wants and needs. In agile development, the customer is regularly in touch with the developers. This doesn't just include at the beginning, for requirements, and at the end, for the finished product, but throughout the development, mitigating the problem of the customer's final product wishes being different from those at the beginning (_www.globalknowledge.com, n.d._).

As mentioned beforehand, the video game industry is massive. In 2021 the value of the global gaming industry has exceeded $300 billion (_Nolibois, 2021_) so it is very big indeed. A lot of children do gaming - 80% of 12-15 year olds have played a game with someone they have met (_Baker, 2022_). If excluding playing with others, the percentage figure would be higher. There is a wide range of gamers out there, and each game intends to please a certain range of gamers. This game would appeal to those who like both educational and fun games. The controls should not be hard to master, as the controls are just arrows, so it could be suitable for younger players.

PEGI (Pan-European Game Information) is a rating system used on games across Europe to determine what the minimum age of a player of a certain game should be. It takes in to account various factors, such as violence, nudity, gambling, and more. The five PEGI age ratings are 3, 7, 12, 16 and 18, each denoting a minimum age (_www.askaboutgames.com, n.d._). The 12, 16 and 18 ratings are enforced when buying games. The mathematical platformer would most likely be PEGI 3 as there would not be violence or any problematic content.

## Demographics

The target demographic is the group of people who you want to play your game. This differs greatly between games. My target demographic is younger people who want to enjoy games but also want to do something educational. Given that 72% of children aged 8-11 play video games online (as well as 41% of children aged 5-7) (_Clement, 2021_), this demographic could be very large. I would need to have a certain degree of educational content in the game so that it is more suitable for younger players, but also a certain degree of fun and difficulty so that the slightly older bracket of these players could enjoy it too.
