# 2.2.4 Cycle 4

## Design

### Objectives

For cycle 4, I want to add a basic maths function to my game. I would like to use the four basic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication and division), and for the numbers and operations to be generated randomly, for more variation within the levels.

* [x] Add maths content to the game
* [x] Add the four basic operations to the game
* [x] Use random generation for the numbers and operations

### Usability Features

### Key Variables

<table><thead><tr><th>Variable name</th><th>Use</th><th data-hidden></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>firstNumber</td><td>Sets the first number.</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>secondNumber</td><td>Sets the second number.</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>operation</td><td>Sets the operation.</td><td></td></tr></tbody></table>

### Pseudocode

```
//generate a random number between 1-10

var number = add
    text: rand 1-10
    position
    value number
```
