# 2.2.4 Cycle 4

## Design

### Objectives

For cycle 4, I want to add a basic maths function to my game. I would like to use the four basic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication and division), and for the numbers and operations to be generated randomly, for more variation within the levels.

* [x] Add maths content to the game
* [x] Add the four basic operations to the game
* [x] Use random generation for the numbers and operations

### Usability Features

Level layout and design: the numbers and operation will be generated randomly. This keeps the game **engaging** as there is more variation.

### Key Variables

<table><thead><tr><th>Variable name</th><th>Use</th><th data-hidden></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>firstNumber</td><td>Sets the first number.</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>secondNumber</td><td>Sets the second number.</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>displayOperation</td><td>Displays the operation.</td><td></td></tr></tbody></table>

### Pseudocode

```
//generate a random number between 1-10

var number = add
    text: rand 1-10
    position
    value number

//generate and display one of three operations

operation = rand 1-3
if operation <- 1 then
    operationText = "+"
else
if operation <- 2 then
    operationText = "-"
else
if operation <- 3 then
    operationText = "*"

var displayOperation = add
    text: operationText
    position
    value operationText
```

## Development

### Outcome

Generating two random numbers was quite easy, but getting an operation to show up correctly was hard. Initially it was showing a random number from 1 to 3, or nothing at all. Eventually, I managed to get it to work with the code below.

```javascript
//code to generate random numbers and operation

var firstNumber = add([ //adds the first number
    text(randi(1, 11)), //generates a random number between 1-10
    pos(50, 50), //sets the position
    { value: firstNumber }, //sets the value of the variable
])

var secondNumber = add([ //adds the second number
    text(randi(1, 11)),
    pos(150, 50),
    { value: secondNumber },
])

operation = randi(1, 4) //generates random number between 1-3
if (operation === 1) {
    operationText = "+";
} else if (operation === 2) {
    operationText = "-";
} else if (operation === 3) {
    operationText = "*";
}

var displayOperation = add([
    text(operationText), //displays the operation
    pos(100, 50), //positioned between the two numbers
    { value: operationText },
])
```

So far, I have not included division. I will add this later if I have time, as I will need to make sure that the answer is a whole number, which might be time-consuming.

### Challenges

Getting the operation to display correctly was a challenge, but I eventually managed to get it to work properly.

## Testing

### Tests

| Tests | Instructions      | What I expect                                                     | What actually happens                                                    | Pass/Fail |
| ----- | ----------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ | --------- |
| 1     | Run original code | Two random numbers will show up, with the operation between them. | Two random numbers show up, but the operation does not display properly. | Fail      |
| 2     | Run improved code | Two random numbers will show up, with the operation between them. | All as expected.                                                         | Pass      |

### Evidence

![](<../.gitbook/assets/image (8) (1) (1) (1) (1).png>)

Two numbers and an operation show up. In this case, the question is 5-8.
