# 2.2.12 Cycle 12

## Design

### Objectives

For cycle 12, I would like to implement the remaining features from my success criteria. These include a pause function, a 'try again' option for the end screens, and linear acceleration.

* [x] Implement a pause screen
* [x] Implement 'try again' options
* [x] Implement linear acceleration

### Usability Features

Engaging: The player will not have to press as many buttons to restart a game.

Efficient: Same as above.

### Key Variables

<table><thead><tr><th>Variable name</th><th>Use</th><th data-hidden></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>onKeyPress</td><td>Does an action when a key is pressed. Certain keys can be specified.</td><td></td></tr></tbody></table>

### Pseudocode

```
//Try again code
onKeyPress "T"
    go "game"
onKeyPress " "
    go "start"
```

## Development

### Outcome

```
//Code for a 'try again' function
onKeyPress("space", () => {
        go("start"); //to go to the start screen again
})
onKeyPress("t", () => {
        go("game"); //to restart
})
```
