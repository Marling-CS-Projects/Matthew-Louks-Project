# 2.2.6 Cycle 6

## Design

### Objectives

For cycle 6, I want to code enemies into the game. I have already made a sprite for the enemies, so I now need to code them. The enemies will be an example of AI in my game - I would like to make them follow the player if the player gets too close.

* [x] Add enemies to the game
* [x] Give them a path
* [x] Make it so they kill the player if the player touches them
* [x] Make it so they spawn not at the same x-coordinate as the player

### Usability Features

Level layout and design, mechanics: Enemies must be generated onto the level, and they must be generated at a distance away from the player. The enemies should follow the player if they get too close.

### Key Variables

### Pseudocode

```
//Code to spawn two enemies

const x = rand 0, width
const y = rand 0, height
for i = 1 to 2
    add
        sprite enemy
        pos x, y
        area
        body
        "danger"
```
