# 2.2.6 Cycle 6

## Design

### Objectives

For cycle 6, I want to code enemies into the game. I have already made a sprite for the enemies, so I now need to code them. The enemies will be an example of AI in my game - I would like to make them follow the player if the player gets too close.

### Usability Features

Level layout and design, mechanics: Enemies must be generated onto the level, and they must be generated at a distance away from the player. The enemies should follow the player if they get too close.
