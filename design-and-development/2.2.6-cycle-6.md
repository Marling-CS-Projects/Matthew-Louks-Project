# 2.2.6 Cycle 6

## Design

### Objectives

For cycle 6, I want to code enemies into the game. I have already made a sprite for the enemies, so I now need to code them. The enemies will be an example of AI in my game - I would like to make them follow the player if the player gets too close.

* [x] Add enemies to the game
* [x] Give them a path
* [x] Make it so they kill the player if the player touches them
* [x] Make it so they spawn not at the same x-coordinate as the player

### Usability Features

Level layout and design, mechanics: Enemies must be generated onto the level, and they must be generated at a distance away from the player. The enemies should follow the player if they get too close.

### Key Variables

<table><thead><tr><th>Variable name</th><th>Use</th><th data-hidden></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>x</td><td>Controls the width of the enemy spawn.</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>y</td><td>Controls the height of the enemy spawn.</td><td></td></tr></tbody></table>

### Pseudocode

```
//Code to spawn two enemies

const x = rand 0, width
const y = rand 0, height
for i = 1 to 2
    add
        sprite enemy
        pos x, y
        area
        body
        "danger"

//Code for an enemy path
function path(speed, dir)
    return
        id: path
        require: pos, area
        add
            on "collide" (obj, col)
            if col.isLeft ¦¦ col.isRight
                dir = -dir
        
        update
            this.move(speed * dir, 0)
```

## Development

### Outcome

This cycle went quite smoothly. I managed to get the enemies to spawn correctly and move. They will turn if a spike is in their way. I have had to change he x and y values for spawning an enemy, so that they do not spawn directly above, by the side of, or even on the player.

```javascript
//Code to spawn two enemies

for (let i = 0; i < 2; i++) { //to spawn, for example, two enemies on the level
    x = rand(100, width());
    y = rand(0, 150);
    add([
        sprite("enemy"),
        pos(x, y), //random position
        area(),
        body(),
        path(),
        "danger",
    ])
}

//Code for an enemy path

function path(speed = 100, dir = 1) { //generates the 'path' function with speed and direction
    return {
        id: "path",
        require: [ "pos", "area" ],
        add() {
            this.on("collide", (obj, col) => { //when an enemy collides with an object...
                if (col.isLeft() || col.isRight()) {
                    dir = -dir //...the enemy's direction is reversed
                }
            })
        },
        update() {
            this.move(speed * dir, 0)
        },
    }
}
```

### Challenges

Initially my path() function was not working properly, but it was because of a simple mistake: there was a bracket that I needed to add.

| 2    | Run code to see if the enemies move properly                         | The enemies will properly move from left to right                              | As expected           | Pass      |
| 3    | Run code to see if the enemies cause the player to get a 'game over' | When the player hits an enemy, the level will change to the 'game over' screen | As expected           | Pass      |

### Evidence

![](<../.gitbook/assets/image (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1).png>)

In the above picture, two enemies have spawned and are moving on the floor. Most of the time at least one of the enemies falls off the level map, so I will try to rectify this at some point.

'Game over' screen that appears when you hit 'danger', i.e. an enemy, a spike or a wrong answer.
