# 2.2.7 Cycle 7

## Design

### Objectives

For cycle 7, I want to create a start screen and a difficulty screen. For now I will keep the looks of these screens simple, as I want to concentrate more on gameplay and mechanics than the aesthetics.

* [x] Create a start screen
* [x] Create a difficulty selection screen

### Usability Features

User Interface: The game should have start and difficulty screens. The latter should allow the player to select how hard they want the player to be. (Effective)
