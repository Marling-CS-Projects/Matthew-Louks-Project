# 2.2.7 Cycle 7

## Design

### Objectives

For cycle 7, I want to create a start screen and a difficulty screen. For now I will keep the looks of these screens simple, as I want to concentrate more on gameplay and mechanics than the aesthetics.

* [x] Create a start screen
* [x] Create a difficulty selection screen
* [x] Make it so that selecting a different difficulty changes some of the parameters

### Usability Features

User Interface: The game should have start and difficulty screens. The latter should allow the player to select how hard they want the levels to be. (Effective)

### Key Variables

<table><thead><tr><th>Variable name</th><th>Use</th><th data-hidden></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>enemyCount</td><td>The number of enemies in the game, selected by pressing 1, 2 or 3 on the keyboard.</td><td></td></tr></tbody></table>

### Pseudocode

```
//Start screen

scene start
    add
        text "Mathematical Platformer - Press any key to start"
            width
    onKeyPress any
        go "difficulty"


//Current setup for difficulty screen

scene difficulty
    add
        text "Press 1 for easy, 2 for medium, or 3 for hard"
            width
    onKeyPress any
        //unfinished
```

## Development

### Outcome

Overall this cycle went pretty well. I have now managed to make various screens for my game. Firstly, there is the start screen. Then, there is the difficulty selection screen where you choose the number of enemies. Finally, when you lose, there is a game over screen tht takes you to the start screen again.

```
//Start scene code
scene("start", () => {
    add([
        text("Mathematical Platformer - Press any key to start", {
            width: width(),
        }),
    ])
    onKeyPress(() => {
        go("difficulty");
    })
})

//Difficulty selection scene code
scene("difficulty", () => {
    add([
        text("Press 1 for easy, 2 for medium, or 3 for hard", {
            width: width(),
        }),
    ])
    onKeyPress("1", () => {
        enemyCount = 1;
    })
    onKeyPress("2", () => {
        enemyCount = 2;
    })
    onKeyPress("3", () => {
        enemyCount = 3;
    })
    onKeyPress(() => {
        go("game");
    })
})

//Game over scene code
scene("game over", () => {
    add([
        text("GAME OVER! Press any key to go to the start menu", {
            width: width(),
        }),
    ])
    onKeyPress(() => {
        go("start");
    })
})
```

### Challenges

I had to make almost everything I had originally part of a new scene called 'game'. Also, I was previously getting errors saying 'enemyCount is not defined', but I fixed this without trying to fix it.

## Testing

### Tests

| Test | Instructions                                 | What I expect                                                                                  | What actually happens | Pass/Fail |
| ---- | -------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------- | --------- |
| 1    | Run original code and press keys as required | The start screen is displayed, then the difficulty screen is displayed when any key is pressed | As expected           | Pass      |
| 2    | Run new code for the new screens             | All screens should function properly                                                           | As expected           | Pass      |
| 3    | Run code and test difficulty selection       | The difficulty selection works as intended                                                     | As expected           | Pass      |

### Evidence

![](<../.gitbook/assets/image (2).png>)

This is the current start screen.

![](<../.gitbook/assets/image (7).png>)

This is the current difficulty selection screen. Pressing a number does nothing at the moment.

![](<../.gitbook/assets/image (8).png>)

One enemy has spawned.

![](<../.gitbook/assets/image (5).png>)

Two enemies have spawned. A lot of the time, at least one enemy falls off of the map.

![](<../.gitbook/assets/image (9).png>)

Three enemies have spawned.

![](<../.gitbook/assets/image (6).png>)

I have now decided to extend the base floor for this map. The floor appears differently on different computers, so when I originally made the floor, there was no large gap on the right-hand side.
