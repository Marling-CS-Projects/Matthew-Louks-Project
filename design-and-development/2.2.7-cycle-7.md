# 2.2.7 Cycle 7

## Design

### Objectives

For cycle 7, I want to create a start screen and a difficulty screen. For now I will keep the looks of these screens simple, as I want to concentrate more on gameplay and mechanics than the aesthetics.

* [x] Create a start screen
* [x] Create a difficulty selection screen

### Usability Features

User Interface: The game should have start and difficulty screens. The latter should allow the player to select how hard they want the player to be. (Effective)

### Key Variables

<table><thead><tr><th>Variable name</th><th>Use</th><th data-hidden></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>difficulty</td><td>The difficulty of the game, selected by pressing 1, 2 or 3 on the keyboard.</td><td></td></tr></tbody></table>

### Pseudocode

```
//Start screen

scene start
    add
        text "Mathematical Platformer - Press any key to start"
            width
    onKeyPress any
        go "difficulty"


//Current setup for difficulty screen

scene difficulty
    add
        text "Press 1 for easy, 2 for medium, or 3 for hard"
            width
    onKeyPress any
        //unfinished
```
