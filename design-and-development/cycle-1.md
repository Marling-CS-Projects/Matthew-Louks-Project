# 2.2.1 Cycle 1

## Design

### Objectives

For my project, I am using Kaboom.js. Kaboom is a popular Javascript programming library that I thought would be good because it has many resources, and it is not as complicated to use as some other programming libraries and languages out there.

For cycle 1, my aim is to create sprites for the player's character and for any platforms, enemies and obstacles, and get them to appear on the game screen. I will try to make the sprites look aesthetically pleasing, and I will distinguish everything by using different colours (see [Success Criteria](../analysis/1.5-success-criteria.md)).

* [x] Create a player sprite
* [x] Create sprites for enemies, obstacles and platforms
* [x] Get the sprites to appear on the game screen

### Usability Features

Non-functional: There will be colours to distinguish everything from one another. It will be obvious as to what is what: the player will be green, enemies will be red, etc.

### Key Variables

| Variable Name | Use                   |
| ------------- | --------------------- |
| foo           | does something useful |

### Pseudocode

```
procedure do_something
    
end procedure
```

### Tests

| Test | Instructions  | What I expect     | What actually happens | Pass/Fail |
| ---- | ------------- | ----------------- | --------------------- | --------- |
| 1    | Run code      | Thing happens     | As expected           | Pass      |
| 2    | Press buttons | Something happens | As expected           | Pass      |
