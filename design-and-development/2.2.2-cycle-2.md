# 2.2.2 Cycle 2

## Design

### Objectives

For cycle 2, I want to give my player movement so it can move left and right, and I want to make it so that the player can jump. For now I will keep it so that movement left and right is at a constant rate - if I have time later on I will add linear acceleration for more realism.

* [x] Give left-and-right movement to the player
* [x] Allow the player to jump
* [x] Make it so that the player sprite responds to physics correctly

### Usability Features

Mechanics: The player will be able to move left and right, and the player will be able to jump. There is a gravity set. (Engaging)

### Key Variables

<table><thead><tr><th>Variable name</th><th>Use</th><th data-hidden></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>speed</td><td>Sets the speed at which the player sprite moves</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>setGravity</td><td>Sets the speed at which the player jumps and falls</td><td></td></tr></tbody></table>

### Pseudocode

```
//set speed and gravity values
const speed = 200
setGravity 500

//set key bindings
onKeyDown left
    player.move -speed, 0

onKeyDown a
    player.move -speed, 0

onKeyDown right
    player.move speed, 0

onKeyDown d
    player.move speed, 0

onKeyDown up
    if player is grounded
        player.jump 200

onKeyDown w
    if player is grounded
        player.jump 200
```

## Development

### Outcome

Overall this cycle went quite smoothly, and I have finished it very quickly. Currently the player can move left and right, jump, and fall according to gravity. If there are no platforms on the floor, the player will keep falling forever. This will be fixed with a floor in the near future.

Current code:

```
import kaboom from "kaboom"

// initialize context
kaboom()

// load assets
loadPedit("player", "/sprites/player.pedit")
loadPedit("enemy", "/sprites/enemy.pedit")
loadPedit("platform", "/sprites/platform.pedit")
loadPedit("spike", "/sprites/spike.pedit")

// add sprites to screen
const player = add([
	// list of components
	sprite("player"),
	pos(80, 40),
	area(),
    body(),
])

add([
    sprite("enemy"),
    pos(120, 40),
    area(),
])

add([
    sprite("platform"),
    pos(80, 120),
    area(),
    body({isStatic: true}),
])

add([
    sprite("spike"),
    pos(200, 40),
    area(),
])

//set speed and gravity values
const speed = 200
setGravity(500)

//set key bindings
onKeyDown("left", () => {
    player.move(-speed, 0)
})

onKeyDown("a", () => {
    player.move(-speed, 0)
})

onKeyDown("right", () => {
    player.move(speed, 0)
})

onKeyDown("d", () => {
    player.move(speed, 0)
})

onKeyDown("up", () => {
    if (player.isGrounded()) {
        player.jump(200)
    }
})

onKeyDown("w", () => {
    if (player.isGrounded()) {
        player.jump(200)
    }
})
```

### Challenges

At one point, my code did not recognise WASD keys, but I fixed this by changing the letters W, A and D in the key bindings section to w, a and d.

## Testing

### Tests

| Test | Instructions                                                           | What I expect                                                                                                                    | What actually happens                                                       | Pass/Fail |
| ---- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------- |
| 1    | Run initial code and press left and right keys, and then A and D keys  | Player will move left when the left and A keys are pressed, and the player will move right when the right and D keys are pressed | As expected with left and right keys, but nothing happens with A and D keys | Fail      |
| 2    | Run improved code and press left and right keys, and then A and D keys | Player will move left when the left and A keys are pressed, and the player will move right when the right and D keys are pressed | As expected in all cases                                                    | Pass      |
| 3    | Run code and press up key, and then W key                              | Player will jump and come back down in both cases                                                                                | As expected                                                                 | Pass      |
| 4    | Run code and make the character fall                                   | Character should fall off the screen, as there is no floor yet                                                                   | As expected                                                                 | Pass      |

### Evidence

![](<../.gitbook/assets/image (6).png>)

As can be seen, the player sprite is resting on a platform. The player cannot pass through the platform, as the platform is coded to be static.

![](<../.gitbook/assets/image (5) (1).png>)

The player can move left and right using the arrow keys.

![](<../.gitbook/assets/image (3).png>)

The player can jump, and react to gravity. Here the player has jumped off of the platform and fell out of the map. When there is a floor in the near future, the player will not be able to fall beneath it.
