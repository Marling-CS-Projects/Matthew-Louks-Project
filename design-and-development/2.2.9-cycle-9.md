# 2.2.9 Cycle 9

## Design

### Objectives

For cycle 9, I would like to make the game more accessible and less buggy in areas. I would like to try and eliminate level screens where it is impossible to hit the correct answer, and I would like to stop error messages from appearing in certain situations (e.g. when you do not select 1, 2 or 3 on the difficulty screen, it then says "enemyCount is not defined").

* [x] Eliminate impossible levels (if possible)
* [x] Eliminate certain bugs

### Usability Features

Non-functional: the game should not crash. There should not be bugs in the game. (Error tolerant, efficient)

Non-functional:  the game should be fun and not too challenging to beat - i.e. there should not be impossible screens. (Engaging)

### Key Variables

### Pseudocode

```
//Try-catch code for 'enemyCount is not defined'
try
    //Code to spawn enemies
catch err
    go "difficulty"
```

## Development

### Outcome

```javascript
//Try-catch code for 'enemyCount is not defined'
try {
    for (let i = 0; i < enemyCount; i++) { //to spawn enemies on the level
        x = rand(100, width());
        y = rand(0, 150);
        add([
            sprite("enemy"),
            pos(x, y), //random position
            area(),
            body(),
            path(),
            "danger",
        ])
    }
}
catch(err) {
    go("difficulty");
}
```

### Challenges

So far, I am finding it hard to eliminate impossible levels as you would have to change many things in order to completely get rid of these unfair levels. I have made some changes such as allowing the answers to be at slightly different heights and different colours, as for more variation, and potentially less chance of impossibility.

## Testing

### Tests

| Test | Instructions                                  | What I expect                                                                                   | What actually happens                        | Pass/Fail |
| ---- | --------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- | --------- |
| 1    | Run original code and input something invalid | Nothing happens                                                                                 | Error message: 'enemyCount is not defined'   | Fail      |
| 2    | Run improved code and input something invalid | Nothing happens                                                                                 | As expected                                  | Pass      |
| 3    | Run original code for correct answer          | Hitting the correct answer when in a cluster should take you to the next question or win screen | It takes you to the game over screen instead | Fail      |

### Evidence

![](<../.gitbook/assets/image (1).png>)

I have made it so that the answers can spawn at mildly varying heights. This should lessen the chance of impossible levels. I have also added random colours for the answers so you can distinguish between them better.
