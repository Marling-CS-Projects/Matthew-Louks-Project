# 2.2.9 Cycle 9

## Design

### Objectives

For cycle 9, I would like to make the game more accessible and less buggy in areas. I would like to try and eliminate level screens where it is impossible to hit the correct answer, and I would like to stop error messages from appearing in certain situations (e.g. when you do not select 1, 2 or 3 on the difficulty screen, it then says "enemyCount is not defined").

* [x] Eliminate impossible levels (if possible)
* [x] Eliminate certain bugs

### Usability Features

Non-functional: the game should not crash. There should not be bugs in the game. (Error tolerant, efficient)
