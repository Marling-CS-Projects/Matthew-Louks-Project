# 2.2.9 Cycle 9

## Design

### Objectives

For cycle 9, I would like to make the game more accessible and less buggy in areas. I would like to try and eliminate level screens where it is impossible to hit the correct answer, and I would like to stop error messages from appearing in certain situations (e.g. when you do not select 1, 2 or 3 on the difficulty screen, it then says "enemyCount is not defined").

* [x] Eliminate impossible levels (if possible)
* [x] Eliminate certain bugs

### Usability Features

Non-functional: the game should not crash. There should not be bugs in the game. (Error tolerant, efficient)

### Key Variables

### Pseudocode

```
//Current try-catch code for 'enemyCount is not defined' (does not work)
try
    onKeyPress any
        go "game"
catch err
    go "difficulty"

//This currently still throws 'enemyCount is not defined'.
```

## Development

### Outcome

```
//Current try-catch code for 'enemyCount is not defined' (does not work)
try {
    onKeyPress(() => {
        go("game");
    })
}
catch(err) {
    go("difficulty");
}
```
