# 2.2.3 Cycle 3

## Design

### Objectives

For cycle 3, I want to create a level layout which I can use for my levels. I would like for the platforms to be generated randomly, as this will keep the players interested, and there will be many different layouts as a result.

* [x] Create a basic level layout
* [x] Use random generation for the platforms

### Usability Features

Level layout and design: the platforms will be generated randomly. This keeps the game **engaging** and fun. I will try to limit unfair platform combinations.

### Key Variables

<table><thead><tr><th>Variable name</th><th>Use</th><th data-hidden></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>i</td><td>Generates three platforms (i = 0, i &#x3C; 3, i++).</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>x</td><td>Randomises the x-position of a platform.</td><td></td></tr></tbody></table>

### Pseudocode

```
//Pseudocode for random generation of ten platforms

for i = 0 to 9
    const x = rand width
    const y = rand height
    add sprite platform
        position(x, y)
        area
        body static
next i

//Pseudocode for random generation of three platforms at a certain
//height (better version, repeated 3 times for y = 50, 100, 150)

for i = 0 to 3
    const x = rand width
    add sprite platform
        position(x, y)
        area
        body static
next i
```

## Development

### Outcome

Overall, this went okay. I initially created an algorithm to randomly generate ten random platforms, but it looked messy when platforms were generated and there was a higher chance of getting an impossible map. I changed it to generate three platforms at a set height, and then repeat this for two other set heights. This gives less chance of impossibility and looks more organised, even if it isn't 'truly' random.

Some code:

```
//Code to create a level structure with a floor
addLevel([
    "          ",
    "          ",
    "          ",
    "          ",
    "==========",
], {
    tileWidth: 50,
    tileHeight: 50,
    tiles: {
        "=": () => [
            sprite("platform"),
            area(),
            body({isStatic: true}),
        ]
    }
})

//Final code for platform generation
for (let i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
    const x = rand(0, width())
    add([
        sprite("platform"),
        pos(x, 50),
        area(),
        body({isStatic: true}),
    ])
}
for (let i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
    const x = rand(0, width())
    add([
        sprite("platform"),
        pos(x, 100),
        area(),
        body({isStatic: true}),
    ])
}
for (let i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
    const x = rand(0, width())
    add([
        sprite("platform"),
        pos(x, 150),
        area(),
        body({isStatic: true}),
    ])
}
```

### Challenges

I do not feel that there were any challenges with this cycle, although I did have to refine my random generation code.

## Testing

### Tests

| Test | Instructions      | What I expect                                                                                       | What actually happens | Pass/Fail |
| ---- | ----------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------- | --------- |
| 1    | Run original code | Generates 10 platforms at random positions                                                          | As expected           | Pass      |
| 2    | Run improved code | Generates 9 platforms (3 platforms at y=50, 3 at y=100 and 3 at y=150, all with random x-positions) | As expected           | Pass      |

### Evidence

![](<../.gitbook/assets/image (5) (1).png>)

Three platforms have generated on each level. Sometimes the platforms merge into each other, as has happened here twice.

![](<../.gitbook/assets/image (7) (1).png>)

The platforms have randomly generated at different positions this time.
