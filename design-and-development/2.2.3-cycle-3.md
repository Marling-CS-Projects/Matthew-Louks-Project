# 2.2.3 Cycle 3

## Design

### Objectives

For cycle 3, I want to create a level layout which I can use for my levels. I would like for the platforms to be generated randomly, as this will keep the players interested, and there will be many different layouts as a result.

### Usability Features

Level layout and design: the platforms will be generated randomly. This keeps the game **engaging** and fun. I will try to limit unfair platform combinations.

### Key Features

<table><thead><tr><th>Variable name</th><th>Use</th><th data-hidden></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr></tbody></table>

### Pseudocode

```
//Pseudocode for random generation of ten platforms

for i = 0 to 9
    const x = rand width
    const y = rand height
    add sprite platform
        position(x, y)
        area
        body static
next i
```
