# 2.2.10 Cycle 10

## Design

### Objectives

For cycle 10, I would like to improve some visual elements of my game. For example, I could give the game a background so everything is more easily distinguishable, and it would look nicer as well. Also, I could change the font in the game for the same reasons.

* [x] Add a background or backgrounds to the game
* [x] Change the font from the standard one to a different one

### Usability Features

User Interface and Non-Functional: The game should use complementing and contrasting colours in order to make navigating the game easier for the player, as well as making the game more enjoyable. (Engaging, effective)
