# 2.2.10 Cycle 10

## Design

### Objectives

For cycle 10, I would like to improve some visual elements of my game. For example, I could give the game a background so everything is more easily distinguishable, and it would look nicer as well. Also, I could change the font in the game for the same reasons.

* [x] Add a background or backgrounds to the game
* [x] Change the font from the standard one to a different one

### Usability Features

User Interface and Non-Functional: The game should use complementing and contrasting colours in order to make navigating the game easier for the player, as well as making the game more enjoyable. (Engaging, effective)

### Key Variables



<table><thead><tr><th>Variable name</th><th>Use</th><th data-hidden></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>background</td><td>Sets the colour of the background using RGB values.</td><td></td></tr></tbody></table>

### Pseudocode

```
//previously:
kaboom

//now:
kaboom:
    background 100, 155, 255 //light blue colour
```

## Development

### Outcome

Overall this was a very quick cycle, as I found it quite easy to find a nice background colour, and for the font, I just used sans-serif, as it is already in the browser and it looks nicer than the standard font on kaboom.

### Challenges

There were no challenges in this cycle.

## Testing

### Tests

| Test | Instruction                         | What I expect                                        | What actually happens | Pass/Fail |
| ---- | ----------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- | --------------------- | --------- |
| 1    | Run code                            | There should be a light blue background              | As expected           | Pass      |
| 2    | Run code and go through all screens | The 'sans-serif' font should be used on every screen | As expected           | Pass      |

### Evidence
