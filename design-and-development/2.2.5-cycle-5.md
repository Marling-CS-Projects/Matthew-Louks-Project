# 2.2.5 Cycle 5

## Design

### Objectives

For cycle 5, I want to code answers into the game. There will be various answers to the questions that the player can hit, but only one will be correct. The correct answer takes the player on to the next question, whereas the wrong answers mean game over.

* [x] Code a correct answer to the questions
* [x] Code other incorrect answers to the questions
* [x] Make a 'game over' screen for if the player hits a wrong answer

### Usability Features

Level layout and design: answers must be generated onto the level, and one must be correct. (Effective, error tolerant)

### Key Variables

### Pseudocode

```
//Code for a correct answer to a question

if operation === 1 then
    answer = firstNumber + secondNumber
else
if operation === 2 then
    answer = firstNumber - secondNumber
else
if operation === 3 then
    answer = firstNumber * secondNumber

const z = rand 0-width
add
    text answer
    pos
    value: answer

//Code for three incorrect answers

for i = 1 to 3
    wrongAnswer = rand 1-100
    const z rand 0 to width
    add
        text wrongAnswer
        pos
```

### Tests

| Test | Instructions                                              | What I expect                                                | What actually happens                                                                | Pass/Fail |
| ---- | --------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | --------- |
| 1    | Run original code for answers                             | There will be one correct answer                             | There is text saying \[object Object] \[object Object] or NaN in place of the answer | Fail      |
| 2    | Run improved code                                         | There will be one correct answer                             | As expected                                                                          | Pass      |
| 3    | Run code for a correct answer and three incorrect answers | There will be one correct answer and three incorrect answers | As expected                                                                          | Pass      |

### Evidence

![](<../.gitbook/assets/image (2).png>)

The question has the correct answer, as shown here.

![](<../.gitbook/assets/image (9).png>)

Same goes here...

![](../.gitbook/assets/image.png)

...and here.

![](<../.gitbook/assets/image (6).png>)

There is one correct answer and three incorrect answers here. The answers are a bit jumbled up at the moment.
