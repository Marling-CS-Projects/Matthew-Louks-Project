# 2.2.5 Cycle 5

## Design

### Objectives

For cycle 5, I want to code answers into the game. There will be various answers to the questions that the player can hit, but only one will be correct. The correct answer takes the player on to the next question, whereas the wrong answers mean game over.

* [x] Code a correct answer to the questions
* [x] Code other incorrect answers to the questions
* [x] Make a 'game over' screen for if the player hits a wrong answer

### Usability Features

Level layout and design: answers must be generated onto the level, and one must be correct. (Effective, error tolerant)

### Tests

| Test | Instructions                  | What I expect                                                | What actually happens | Pass/Fail |
| ---- | ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | --------------------- | --------- |
| 1    | Run original code for answers | There will be one correct answer and three incorrect answers |                       |           |
|      |                               |                                                              |                       |           |
|      |                               |                                                              |                       |           |
