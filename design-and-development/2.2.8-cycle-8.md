# 2.2.8 Cycle 8

## Design

### Objectives

For cycle 8, I want to code the score system and win screen into the game. Once the player has 10 correct answers, they would win the game. This means I must code the correct answers to work, and to add one to the score counter and generate another question.

### Usability Features

User Interface: There will be a score counter and a win screen. (Engaging)

### Key Variables

<table><thead><tr><th>Variable name</th><th>Use</th><th data-hidden></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>score</td><td>Shows the number of correct answers in a game.</td><td></td></tr></tbody></table>

### Pseudocode

```
//Code to increment the score counter, and 'win' when a score of 10 is reached
player onCollide "correct"
    score += 1
    if score = 10 then
        go "win"
    else
        go "game"
```

## Development

### Outcome

This cycle was quite easy. Coding a score counter is easy enough as you just need a variable and a way to increment said variable. I have also coded a win screen for if you get 10 questions right.

```javascript
//Score counter and win screen code (win screen code does not work properly yet)

let score = 0;
//Later on
player.onCollide("correct", () => {
    score += 1;
    if (score === 10) {
        go("win"); //if you reach 10 points, you win
    } else {
        go("game"); //if you hit the correct answer, you get another question and answer set
    }
})
scene("win", () => {
    score = 0; //resets the score for the next game
    add([
        text("You got 10 questions correct. YOU WIN! Press any key to go to the start menu", {
            width: width(),
        })
    ])
    onKeyPress(() => {
        go("start");
    })
})
```

### Challenges

I struggled to get the win screen to work properly, but I realised that there was a problem with the layout of the code I had, and it worked once I changed the layout.

## Testing

### Tests

| Test | Instructions                     | What I expect                                          | What actually happens             | Pass/Fail |
| ---- | -------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------- | --------- |
| 1    | Run code                         | When I hit a correct answer, the score increments by 1 | As expected                       | Pass      |
| 2    | Run original code for win screen | When the score is 10, the win screen is displayed      | There is an error message instead | Fail      |
| 3    | Run improved code for win screen | When the score is 10, the win screen is displayed      | As expected                       | Pass      |

### Evidence

![](<../.gitbook/assets/image (1) (4).png>)

The score is 0. I will hit a correct answer and it should change to 1.

![](<../.gitbook/assets/image (2).png>)

And it has changed to 1, as I wanted.

![](<../.gitbook/assets/image (3).png>)

I have set the score to 9. When I hit the correct answer, the win screen will be displayed.

Here is the current win screen.
