# 2.2.8 Cycle 8

## Design

### Objectives

For cycle 8, I want to code the score system and win screen into the game. Once the player has 10 correct answers, they would win the game. This means I must code the correct answers to work, and to add one to the score counter and generate another question.

### Usability Features

User Interface: There will be a score counter and a win screen. (Engaging)

### Key Variables

<table><thead><tr><th>Variable name</th><th>Use</th><th data-hidden></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>score</td><td>Shows the number of correct answers in a game.</td><td></td></tr></tbody></table>

### Pseudocode

```
//Code to increment the score counter, and 'win' when a score of 10 is reached
player onCollide "correct"
    score += 1
    if score = 10 then
        go "win"
    go "game"
```

## Development

### Outcome

This cycle was quite easy. Coding a score counter is easy enough as you just need a variable and a way to increment said variable. I have also coded a win screen for if you get 10 questions right.

```
//Score counter and win screen code

let score = 0;
//Later on
player.onCollide("correct", () => {
    score += 1;
    if (score === 10) {
        go("win"); //if you reach 10 points, you win
    }
    go("game"); //if you hit the correct answer, you get another question and answer set
})
scene("win", () => {
    add([
        text("You got 10 questions correct. YOU WIN! Press any key to go to the start menu", {
            width: width(),
        })
    ])
})
```
