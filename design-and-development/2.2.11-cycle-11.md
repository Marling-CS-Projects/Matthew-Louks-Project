# 2.2.11 Cycle 11

## Design

### Objectives

For cycle 11, I want to do more cleaning up on my game. Until now, I have not had a 'fall death' where the player loses if they fall off of the map. I will implement that in this cycle. I will also try again to stop impossible levels, as they have not gone away yet.

* [x] Add a 'fall death' feature
* [x] Try to stop impossible levels again

### Usability Features

Error tolerant - there will not be a problem where the game will run infinitely when the player falls off of the map.

### Key Variables

<table><thead><tr><th>Variable name</th><th>Use</th><th data-hidden></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>player.pos.y</td><td>The player will lose when they fall off of the map (in other words, when the y-value goes above 250).</td><td></td></tr></tbody></table>

### Pseudocode

```
//fall death code

if player.pos.y >= 250
    score = 0
    go "game over"
```

## Development

### Outcome

I have successfully managed to implement fall-death in my code - by killing the player when they go above a certain y-coordinate. I have also decided to implement a screen giving instructions on how to move the player.

```
//fall death code
player.onUpdate(() => {
    if (player.pos.y >= 250) { //if the player goes below a certain y-position, game over
        score = 0;
        go("game over");
    }
})

//changed code for enemies: x-width was 100 to width, now 150 to width
for (let i = 0; i < enemyCount; i++) { //to spawn enemies on the level
    x = rand(150, width());
    y = rand(0, 150);
    add([
        sprite("enemy"),
        pos(x, y), //random position
        area(),
        body(),
        path(),
        "danger",
    ])

//instructions
scene("instructions", () => {
    add([
        text("Press the left and right arrow keys to move left and right. Press the up arrow key to jump. OR: Press the A and D keys to move left and right. Press the W key to jump", {
            width: width(),
            font: "sans-serif"
        })
    ])
    onKeyPress(() => {
        go("game");
    })
})

//new code for wrong answers: tries to stop wrongAnswer being the same as answer
for (let i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
    let wrongAnswer = randi(1, 101); //generates a random number between 1 and 100
    if (wrongAnswer === answer) {
        i -= 1;
    }
    const z = rand(0, width());
    const w = rand(10, 25);
    const a = rand(0, 255);
    const b = rand(0, 255);
    const c = rand(0, 255);
    if (wrongAnswer !== answer) {
        add([
            text(wrongAnswer, {
                font: "sans-serif",
            }),
            pos(z, w),
            area(),
            color(a, b, c),
            "danger", //shows that this will kill the player if touched
        ])
    }
}
```

### Challenges

Sadly, I have still not managed to eliminate impossible levels.

## Testing

### Tests

| Test | Instructions      | What I expect        | What actually happens | Pass/Fail |
| ---- | ----------------- | -------------------- | --------------------- | --------- |
| 1    | Fall off map      | Death screen appears | As expected           | Pass      |
| 2    | Load instructions | Instructions appear  | As expected           | Pass      |
