# 2.2.11 Cycle 11

## Design

### Objectives

For cycle 11, I want to do more cleaning up on my game. Until now, I have not had a 'fall death' where the player loses if they fall off of the map. I will implement that in this cycle. I will also try again to stop impossible levels, as they have not gone away yet.

* [x] Add a 'fall death' feature
* [x] Try to stop impossible levels again

### Usability Features

Error tolerant - there will not be a problem where the game will run infinitely when the player falls off of the map.

### Key Variables

<table><thead><tr><th>Variable name</th><th>Use</th><th data-hidden></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>player.pos.y</td><td>The player will lose when they fall off of the map (in other words, when the y-value goes above 250).</td><td></td></tr></tbody></table>

### Pseudocode

```
//fall death code

if player.pos.y >= 250
    score = 0
    go "game over"
```

## Development

### Outcome

I have successfully managed to implement fall-death in my code - by killing the player when they go above a certain y-coordinate.

```
//fall death code
player.onUpdate(() => {
    if (player.pos.y >= 250) { //if the player goes below a certain y-position, game over
        score = 0;
        go("game over");
    }
})

//changed code for enemies: x-width was 100 to width, now 150 to width
for (let i = 0; i < enemyCount; i++) { //to spawn enemies on the level
    x = rand(150, width());
    y = rand(0, 150);
    add([
        sprite("enemy"),
        pos(x, y), //random position
        area(),
        body(),
        path(),
        "danger",
    ])
```

### Challenges

Currently I am still struggling to get rid of impossible levels, but I am working on it.
