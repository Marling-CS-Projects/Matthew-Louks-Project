# 2.2.11 Cycle 11

## Design

### Objectives

For cycle 11, I want to do more cleaning up on my game. Until now, I have not had a 'fall death' where the player loses if they fall off of the map. I will implement that in this cycle. I will also try again to stop impossible levels, as they have not gone away yet.

* [x] Add a 'fall death' feature
* [x] Try to stop impossible levels again

### Usability Features

Error tolerant - there will not be a problem where the game will run infinitely when the player falls off of the map.

### Key Variables

<table><thead><tr><th>Variable name</th><th>Use</th><th data-hidden></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>player.pos.y</td><td>The player will lose when they fall off of the map.</td><td></td></tr></tbody></table>

### Pseudocode

```
//fall death code

if player.pos.y >= 250
    go "game over"
```
