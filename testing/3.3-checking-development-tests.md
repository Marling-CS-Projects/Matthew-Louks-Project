# 3.3 Checking Development Tests

A complete set of tests should be run to assess the final solution.

They could be plucked from the tests in your dev cycles, or be new tests that run the system as a whole.

## Tests

| Test | Instructions                             | What I expect                                                                                               | Pass/Fail |
| ---- | ---------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------- |
| 1    | Press all movement arrows                | The character moves in the desired way (with linear acceleration)                                           | Pass      |
| 2    | Press P and then space                   | The game pauses and then unpauses                                                                           | Pass      |
| 3    | Hit a correct answer                     | You are generated another level (unless the score bcomes 10, in which case you are taken to the win screen) | Pass      |
| 4    | Hit a wrong answer, an enemy and a spike | You are taken to the 'game over' screen in all three cases                                                  | Pass      |
