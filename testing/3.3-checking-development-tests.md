| Test | Instruction                                  | Expected result                                                                                                  | Pass/Fail |

| 1    | Press left and right keys, then A and D keys | The player moves left when left and A keys are pressed. The player moves right when right and D keys are pressed | Pass      |
| 2    | Press up and W keys                          | The player jumps when either key is pressed                                                                      | Pass      |
