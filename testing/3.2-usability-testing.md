| Test               | Test Details                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| ------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1 - Effective      | Users can achieve the goal with completeness and accuracy. To do this, I will make it easy for the players to realise that they need to reach a goal in order to complete a level. I will make this goal clear to see so there is no confusion over where the players need to go.                  |
| 2 - Efficient      | The speed and accuracy to which a user can complete the goal. To do this, I will create a menu system which is easy to navigate through in order for to find what you are looking for. The information which is more important can be found with less clicks.                                      |
| 3 - Engaging       | The solution is engaging for the user to use. To do this, I will create some levels to keep the players engaged and allow them to have fun while playing the game. Using vector style art will also make the game nicer to look at than blocks, so will draw more people in, keeping them engaged. |
| 4 - Error Tolerant | The solution should have as few errors as possible and if one does occur, it should be able to correct itself. To do this, I will write my code to manage as many different game scenarios as possible so that it will not crash when someone is playing it.                                       |
| 5 - Easy to Learn  | The solution should be easy to use and not be over complicated. To do this, I will create simple controls for the game. I will make sure that no more controls are added than are needed in order to keep them as simple as possible for the players.                                              |

## Usability Requirements in Success Criteria

Some of the success criteria requirements fall into the section of usability. These will also be tested now and are listed below:
