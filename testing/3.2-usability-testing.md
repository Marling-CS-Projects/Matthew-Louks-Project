# 3.2 Usability Testing

## Criteria To Assess

| Test               | Test Details                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| ------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1 - Effective      | Users can achieve the goal with completeness and accuracy. To do this, I will make it easy for the players to realise that they need to reach a goal in order to complete a level. I will make this goal clear to see so there is no confusion over where the players need to go.                  |
| 2 - Efficient      | The speed and accuracy to which a user can complete the goal. To do this, I will create a menu system which is easy to navigate through in order for to find what you are looking for. The information which is more important can be found with less clicks.                                      |
| 3 - Engaging       | The solution is engaging for the user to use. To do this, I will create some levels to keep the players engaged and allow them to have fun while playing the game. Using vector style art will also make the game nicer to look at than blocks, so will draw more people in, keeping them engaged. |
| 4 - Error Tolerant | The solution should have as few errors as possible and if one does occur, it should be able to correct itself. To do this, I will write my code to manage as many different game scenarios as possible so that it will not crash when someone is playing it.                                       |
| 5 - Easy to Learn  | The solution should be easy to use and not be over complicated. To do this, I will create simple controls for the game. I will make sure that no more controls are added than are needed in order to keep them as simple as possible for the players.                                              |

Descriptions from [cycle 2.1](../design-and-development/systems-diagram.md)

I have sent out a Google Form to various people in order to get feedback on my game on what was good, what was bad, were there bugs, etc.

Listed below are the results to the questions. I will go over the results in depth during the [evaluation](broken-reference).

### User Feedback

Here is my current feedback for my game. I got feedback by sending some friends and family a Google Form. I have posted the Google Form on my Google Classroom page to see if it allows the form to get more responses. I have had a total of eight responses to my form, and the answers given in the responses are shown below.

![](<../.gitbook/assets/image (5).png>)

It is good to see that people find the game obvious in terms of what to do - if the game is to be accessible this is a must. However, unfortunately a few people see the game as unfair due to the problem of impossible answers.

![](<../.gitbook/assets/image (1) (1) (1) (1) (1).png>)

People find the game easy to understand and they find that the instructions screen is useful. Again, for a game to be accessible things like this are essential, as people will want to know and understand what to do.

![](<../.gitbook/assets/image (2) (1) (1).png>)

The pause function works, which is good. This could have just been a yes/no/sometimes question, however. The game's framerate is also consistent amongst the playtesters, which is good to see.

![](<../.gitbook/assets/image (3) (1) (1).png>)

Everyone finds the game engaging, which is great. Many people see the game as fun, too: there are no below-average scores, and two people out gave it a maximum of 5/5 - great to see, as I want my game to be as fun as possible.

![](<../.gitbook/assets/image (4) (1) (1).png>)

These two questions have somewhat mixed replies, but mostly 'strongly agree' - a good response for these questions, implying that the game is easy to learn and play, with easy controls.

![](<../.gitbook/assets/image (5) (1).png>)

There are no crashes with the game and it is PEGI 3 - some of the non-functional success criteria met.

![](<../.gitbook/assets/image (6).png>)

![](<../.gitbook/assets/image (7).png>)

![](<../.gitbook/assets/image (33).png>)

The game is responsive: another non-functional success criterion met. There have been a variety of bugs reported, however. There are reports of impossible levels, which I was aware of during development and testing, caused by overlapping answers. Also, some people have reported bad level generation - this is due to the random aspect, and I am unsure how to fix this.

Overall, most of the feedback is good, however many people saw the game as unfair. I edited my title screen part of the way through getting these responses to give instructions on what size the screen should be in order to stop the floor platforms being too short and making the game unfair.

## Usability Requirements in Success Criteria

Some of the success criteria requirements fall into the section of usability. These will also be tested now and are listed below:

| Criterion | Description                                                                         |
| --------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 2         | Everything on the level screen needs to be obvious to the player                    |
| 3         | The game must also be fair. An unfair game is not accessible                        |
| 7         | Enemies and obstacles must be generated at a distance away from the player          |
| 8         | The game should have a simple-to-understand menu                                    |
| 11        | The game should have a pause function                                               |
| 12        | At the end of a game, there should be options to try again or to return to the menu |
| 23        | There should be colours that distinguish platforms, obstacles, enemies etc.         |

Descriptions from [cycle 1.5](../analysis/1.5-success-criteria.md)

### Criterion 2

This criterion states that everything you see in the game should be obvious to the player, in terms of what is what, what to do, etc. Here is a typical screenshot of my game:

![](<../.gitbook/assets/image (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1).png>)

There is a maths question on the left, there are four answers, of which one is correct, and there is an enemy to avoid. There are also spikes to avoid on each side of the floor. I would say everything here is pretty obvious to me (the player). Also, there is an instructions screen, so everything in terms of how to move the player should have been made clear too.

### Criterion 3

This criterion states that the game must be fair. There should not be any bugs or elements of unfairness in the game. I think the game is _mostly_ fair - there are a few problems, such as ocasionally getting screens where it is seemingly impossible to hit the correct answer because a wrong answer is blocking it. Also, I noticed that an enemy was able to move a spike when generating in a certain area, and sometimes enemies stop moving if they are locked together. Despite these flaws, the game is mostly fair to the player.

### Criterion 7

This criterion exists so players are not immediately killed by an enemy when a level is generated. I have not been killed by an enemy spawning on top of me when doing recent playtests of my game, although some earlier-on tests had - I think I have rectified this now. I had tried to solve this earlier in development by changing a parameter so enemies do not spawn in the same x-coordinate area as the player.

### Criterion 8

This criterion states the game's menu should be simple and easy to understand. Here are my menus:

![](<../.gitbook/assets/image (13).png>)

The old main menu screen.

![](<../.gitbook/assets/image (9).png>)

The new main menu screen with sizing instructions.

![](<../.gitbook/assets/image (14).png>)

The difficulty selection screen. This only changes the number of enemies.

![](<../.gitbook/assets/image (15).png>)

The instructions screen.

I would say these screens are simple and easy to understand, as they are just text on a background, without any unnecessary details or information.

### Criterion 11

This criterion states that the player should be able to pause the game. Pausing allows the player to take a break, and is a common feature in games. Here is my game's pause function in action:

![](<../.gitbook/assets/image (18).png>)

Note the pause icon in the top-right corner: this lets you know that the game is paused. The function works perfectly, and you can unpause and continue playing the game when you want to. Pausing is easy too, as you just press P to pause and the space bar to unpause.

### Criterion 12

This criterion states that you should be able to immediately try again when you finish a game, or go back to the main menu. As per previous comments in design and development, you are able to try again or return to the main menu when you either win or get a game over. Also, as the try again/return to menu screen is just text on a background, it is easy to understand.

### Criterion 23

This states that there should be colours to distinguish everything. As can be seen in the screenshots for criteria 2 and 11, the answers are in different colours, generated randomly with colour parameters. In addition, the text, player and enemies are contrasting colours, which both contrast with the background, so everything is distinguished from one another.
