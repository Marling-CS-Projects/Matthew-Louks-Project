# 3.2 Usability Testing

## Criteria To Assess

| Test               | Test Details                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| ------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1 - Effective      | Users can achieve the goal with completeness and accuracy. To do this, I will make it easy for the players to realise that they need to reach a goal in order to complete a level. I will make this goal clear to see so there is no confusion over where the players need to go.                  |
| 2 - Efficient      | The speed and accuracy to which a user can complete the goal. To do this, I will create a menu system which is easy to navigate through in order for to find what you are looking for. The information which is more important can be found with less clicks.                                      |
| 3 - Engaging       | The solution is engaging for the user to use. To do this, I will create some levels to keep the players engaged and allow them to have fun while playing the game. Using vector style art will also make the game nicer to look at than blocks, so will draw more people in, keeping them engaged. |
| 4 - Error Tolerant | The solution should have as few errors as possible and if one does occur, it should be able to correct itself. To do this, I will write my code to manage as many different game scenarios as possible so that it will not crash when someone is playing it.                                       |
| 5 - Easy to Learn  | The solution should be easy to use and not be over complicated. To do this, I will create simple controls for the game. I will make sure that no more controls are added than are needed in order to keep them as simple as possible for the players.                                              |

Descriptions from [cycle 2.1](../design-and-development/systems-diagram.md)

Listed below are the results to the questions. I will go over the results in depth during the evaluation

### User Feedback

## Usability Requirements in Success Criteria

Some of the success criteria requirements fall into the section of usability. These will also be tested now and are listed below:

| Criterion | Description                                                                         |
| --------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 2         | Everything on the level screen needs to be obvious to the player                    |
| 3         | The game must also be fair. An unfair game is not accessible                        |
| 7         | Enemies and obstacles must be generated at a distance away from the player          |
| 8         | The game should have a simple-to-understand menu                                    |
| 11        | The game should have a pause function                                               |
| 12        | At the end of a game, there should be options to try again or to return to the menu |
| 23        | There should be colours that distinguish platforms, obstacles, enemies etc.         |

### Criterion 2

This criterion states that everything you see in the game should be obvious to the player, in terms of what is what, what to do, etc. Here is a typical screenshot of my game:

![](../.gitbook/assets/image.png)

There is a maths question on the left, there are four answers, of which one is correct, and there is an enemy to avoid. There are also spikes to avoid on each side of the floor. I would say everything here is pretty obvious to me (the player).

### Criterion 3

This criterion states that the game must be fair. There should not be any bugs or elements of unfairness in the game. I think the game is _mostly_ fair - there are a few problems, such as ocasionally getting screens where it is seemingly impossible to hit the correct answer because a wrong answer is blocking it. Also, I noticed that an enemy was able to move a spike when generating in a certain area, and sometimes enemies stop moving if they are locked together. Despite these flaws, the game is mostly fair to the player.

### Criterion 7

This criterion exists so players are not immediately killed by an enemy when a level is generated. I have not been killed by an enemy spawning on top of me when doing recent playtests of my game. I had tried to solve this earlier in development by changing a parameter so enemies do not spawn in the same x-coordinate area as the player.

### Criterion 8

This criterion states the game's menu should be simple and easy to understand. Here are my menus:

![](<../.gitbook/assets/image (13).png>)

The main menu screen.

![](<../.gitbook/assets/image (14).png>)

The difficulty selection screen. This only changes the number of enemies.

![](<../.gitbook/assets/image (15).png>)

The instructions screen.

I would say these screens are simple and easy to understand.

### Criterion 11

This criterion states that the player should be able to pause the game. Pausing allows the player to take a break, and is a common feature in games. Here is my game's pause function in action:

![](<../.gitbook/assets/image (17).png>)

Note the pause icon in the top-right corner: this lets you know that the game is paused. The function works perfectly, and you can unpause and continue playing the game when you want to.

### Criterion 12

This criterion states that you should be able to immediately try again when you finish a game, or go back to the main menu. As per previous comments in design and development, you are able to try again or return to the main menu when you either win or get a game over.

### Criterion 23

This states that there should be colours to distinguish everything. As can be seen in the screenshots for criteria 2 and 11, the answers are in different colours, generated randomly with colour parameters. In addition, the player and enemies are contrasting colours, which both contrast with the background, so everything is distinguished from one another.
