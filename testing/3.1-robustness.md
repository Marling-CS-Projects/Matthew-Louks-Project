# 3.1 Testing for Function and Robustness

## Criteria To Assess

Here are the success criteria that I have found that I think relate to function and robustness.

| Criterion | Description                                                              |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 17        | Enemies should respond to physics in the same way as the player          |
| 18        | The player and any enemies must not clip through platforms and obstacles |
| 19        | The game must follow the requirements of PEGI 3                          |
| 20        | The game should not crash                                                |
| 21        | The game should run smoothly                                             |
| 22        | The game should be responsive to user input                              |

Descriptions from [cycle 1.5](../analysis/1.5-success-criteria.md)

### Criterion 17

This criterion states that enemies should respond to physics in the same way as the player. In other words, the way the enemies move, collide with platforms and spikes, etc. should be the same as the player. The enemies move in the same way, i.e. left and right, as the player. When enemies collide with platforms, they change direction, rather than clipping through them or in other ways glitching out, so this is good. When they hit spikes, they also change direction as intended, whilst the player dies when they hit a spike. Everything with the enemies works as intended, which I am pleased about.

### Criterion 18

This criterion is part of ensuring that my game's mechanics run as they should. With games, any characters or objects must no clip through walls, platforms, etc. I have tested this by crashing my player character into platforms, spikes and enemies and I have made sure that there is no clipping. During my tests, there have been no visible glitches, clips or anything of the like.

### Criterion 19

This criterion ensures that there is no content in my game that is unsuitable for PEGI 3 requirements.

My game has enemies and spikes in it, but there is no gore and I would not say the spikes or enemies look scary. The description of PEGI 3 is:

_The content of games with a PEGI 3 rating is considered suitable for all age groups. The game should not contain any sounds or pictures that are likely to frighten young children. A very mild form of violence (in a comical context or a childlike setting) is acceptable. (PEGI Public Site, n.d.)_

The game does not have sound in it, and I would not say the enemies are likely to frighten young children. The game does not include violence. As such, I would say my game fits PEGI 3.

### Criterion 20

This criterion is also part of ensuring that my game's mechanics are up to scratch. I have played my game some times before and I have never had the game crash on me. I have played the game both on my laptop at home, as well as on the computer at school, as part of testing. Neither system has crashed in the game at any point during testing.

### Criterion 21

This criterion is again part of testing the mechanics. When I have played my game before, I have never had lag or rough running.

Using the debug.inspect function, I can see my game normally runs at at least 30 FPS, which is good.

![](<../.gitbook/assets/image (1) (1) (1).png>)

With the in-game screen (the bottom one from above), sometimes the game runs at about 60 FPS, and sometimes it has run at only about 30. Either way, it is above my target of at least 30 FPS.

### Criterion 22

This criterion also tests the mechanics. It ensures that pressing all the buttons that you can in the game always give a response, rather than buttons not doing anything. I have tested this by doing every possible input in the game and ensured that all inputs work as they should. I have not had any unintended consequences of pressing buttons, and all buttons I have pressed have worked properly, so the game is responsive to user input.
