# 3.1 Testing for Function and Robustness

## Criteria To Assess

Find success criteria that relate to function and robustness

| Criterion | Description                                                              |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 18        | The player and any enemies must not clip through platforms and obstacles |
| 19        | The game must follow the requirements of PEGI 3                          |
| 20        | The game should not crash                                                |
| 21        | The game should run smoothly                                             |
| 22        | The game should be responsive to user input                              |

### Criterion 18

This criterion is part of ensuring that my game's mechanics run as they should. With games, any characters or objects must no clip through walls, platforms, etc. I have tested this by crashing my player character into platforms, spikes and enemies and I have made sure that there is no clipping. During my tests, there have been no visible glitches, clips or anything of the like.

### Criterion 19

This criterion ensures that there is no content in my game that is unsuitable for PEGI 3 requirements.

My game has enemies and spikes in it, but there is no gore and I would not say the spikes or enemies look scary. The description of PEGI 3 is:

_The content of games with a PEGI 3 rating is considered suitable for all age groups. The game should not contain any sounds or pictures that are likely to frighten young children. A very mild form of violence (in a comical context or a childlike setting) is acceptable. (PEGI Public Site, n.d.)_

The game does not have sound in it, and I would not say the enemies are likely to frighten young children. The game does not include violence. As such, I would say my game fits PEGI 3.

### Criterion 20

This criterion is also part of ensuring that my game's mechanics are up to scratch. I have played my game some times before and I have never had the game crash on me.

### Criterion 21

This criterion is again part of testing the mechanics. When I have played my game before, I have never had lag or rough running.

Using the debug.inspect function, I can see my game normally runs at at least 30 FPS, which is good.

### Criterion 22

This criterion also tests the mechanics. It ensures that pressing all the buttons that you can in the game always give a response, rather than buttons not doing anything. I have tested this by doing every possible input in the game and ensured that all inputs work as they should. I have not had any unintended consequences of pressing buttons, and all buttons I have pressed have worked properly, so the game is responsive to user input.
